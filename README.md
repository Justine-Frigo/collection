# The Collection
We had two days (18th and 19th of april 2024) to create a website with around ten cards, like a collection. We had to choose a theme from a non-exhaustive list, such as ones favourite music, films, recipes, etc...  
Personally, I've chosen to present 10 books that I've read and enjoyed.

## The Project
We had to create our project using the DOM in JavaScript and style it using Sass. The website had to be responsive.

### Languages
Here is a list of the languages used : 
- HTML
- SCSS / CSS
- Javascript
